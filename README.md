![Project](Images/newa.jpg)
## Project Background

This project analyzes data from New York’s Citi Bike program, one of the largest bike-sharing initiatives in the United States. The goal of this analysis is to create insightful visualizations and dashboards in Tableau to help city officials understand key trends and usage patterns within the program. These insights are intended to guide decisions on infrastructure improvements and potential programmatic changes.

### About Citi Bike
Since its inception in 2013, the Citi Bike program has grown to serve millions of users across New York. The program collects detailed data on bike usage every month, making it available publicly for research and reporting. In this project, the focus is on aggregating, visualizing, and analyzing these data points to identify notable trends.

## Project Objective

The primary aim is to address critical questions city officials might have about Citi Bike’s usage, including but not limited to:
1. Monthly and seasonal ridership trends.
2. User patterns and demographics.
3. Popular starting and ending stations.
4. Bike usage duration and repair requirements.
5. Geographic trends in usage.

This project uses Tableau Public to create interactive and static visualizations, along with dashboards and a story presentation, to narrate the Citi Bike journey in New York effectively.
